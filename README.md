# WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET

### Description
Create a SPA ( Single Page Application) that contains a text box and block cards of people of my choosing that are displayed in the DOM. Every even numbered element, has a light yellow background, every odd numbered element has a light blue background. When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border will appear around it.  When you click on one of the person elements, the text input will immediately gain focus so that you can start typing.  When there is a highlighted person element, and you begin typing in the input box, the person's biography will be immediately bound to what you are typing, letter by letter.  When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, the content of the input field will immediately be blank.
